### What I learned

In this work, we have improved our programming skills. Especially css, html and js. 
We learned how to make a website using various animations, add interactivity, make forms for registration and login.

@keyframes glowing {
    0% { background-position: 0 0; }
    50% { background-position: 400% 0; }
    100% { background-position: 0 0; }
}   --- animation for neon and colorful button

### Continued development

We wrote this project pretty well. Developed their programming skills. However, despite this, we still have to 
finalize and bring the work to the ideal. In the future, it will be possible to improve the design and interactivity,
add various functions, such as booking books online and so on.
